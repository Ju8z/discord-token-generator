# discord-token-generator

Generate discord tokens with random generated email and if needed phone verification.

Use your own API Tokens those in configuration are just examples.

0. Configuration can be found in run.py
1. Install the latest python (I've used python10.4)
2. Install dependencies using: pip install -r req.txt
3. Go to project and folder and run this command: python3 run.py

 

Troubleshooting
----------------
If you have this problem ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6261338/167702364-3436b035-c1d1-43a2-a19b-85eb46137fc9.png)
that means your proxy suck! Use mobile proxies from "Bright Data" and use VPS from https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8954163 (by refering youll get some goodies). Also do not forget to whitelist the IP from VPS!

----------------

Many email services are not valid since their emails already used for discord. You can check RapidAPI and chose some another api the code of api is almost
identical everywhere. Also don't forget free RapidAPI version have only 50 calls per day.
