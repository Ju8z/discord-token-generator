# discord-token-generator

Generate discord tokens with random generated email and if needed phone verification.

0. Configuration can be found in run.py
1. Install the latest python (I've used python10.4)
2. Install dependencies using: pip install -r req.txt
3. Go to project and folder and run this command: python3 run.py

Note:
Many email services are not valid since their emails already used for discord. You can check RapidAPI and chose some another api the code of api is almost
identical everywhere.
